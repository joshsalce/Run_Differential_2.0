# Chart the Run Differential 2.0

As mentioned in my 1.0 version of this application, I kept going on this project as it occurred to me that I should be able to do this with all 30 teams at once. That's basically the difference between 1.0 and 2.0: 2.0 includes all the teams. In the 1.0 version, you pick the team and year that you want to see. The 2.0 version requires only a year be inputted by the user.
